# RecipeHub

## Description

MSU Coding Bootcamp Group Project 2: RecipeHub

The purpose of this project was to work as a team to create a real-world full-stack application. The project fulfills he following requirements:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive and interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Future development would include:

- Allowing a user to import recipes from the web
- Improved structure of ingredients
- Add user input validation and improved error messages
